A Hund named Max got into a BMW with his owner to go to the Airport in Berlin.
Along the way, they ate bratwurst and listened to rock musik.
Max and his owner got to the flughafen to board their flight from Berlin to Munich.
After they arrived, they rented  an Audi to cruise on the hauptstrasse.
Max later found a baeckerei that sold gebaeck outside of the Allianz Arena.
Max and his owner decided to get tickets to watch Bayern Munich play a wettbewerbsfaehig match against Borussia Dortmund for the Bundesliga title.
The soccer game was a blast, but Max and his owner were ready for some musik.
Max's owner needed to go buy a pair of lederhose for a Rammstein concert at the local biergarten.
The biergarten was packed with local fans ready to see Rammstein perform when suddenly Max found Dr. Mehlhase!
Max, his owner and Dr. Mehlhase had a blast together at the concert, but they each went to their homes to cool off with the klimaanlage.
Max and his owner only had two days left before they needed to go to the flughafen and fly home.
Later Mehlhase went back out to a baeckerei.
The fresh Bratwurst buns were just coming out of the oven, so she bought 8 buns.
Just then a young boy ran into the baeckeri; he stared longingly at the fresh Gebaeck on the counter.
